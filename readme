- Open a terminal : npx serve .
- Go to browser: http://localhost:3000/dist/

The scene will be load to the browser


To customize the scene, we have 3 things can change in the scene:

1: Env map
 place your .png or .exr files in custom/textures
 then indicate their names in custom_env.txt by replace 2 lines in the text file

 -> first line must be name of EXR file
 -> second line must be name of png file

And the files must exist in the custom/textures folder

2: room model
 place you glb file in custom/models
 then indicate their names in custom_scene.txt by replace the only line in the text file

the files must exist in the custom/models folder

3: lighting 
open the custom_lights.txt
just adjust the parameters of the files to change directional light and points light in the scene
You can add more lights in the file
 Note: There is one Ambient Light in the scene -> to adjust its intensity 

 open index.html -> find line 96  -> scene.add(new THREE.AmbientLight(0xffffff, 1.0))
 1.0 is the intensity -> change that to adjust the intensity of the ambient light in the scene
